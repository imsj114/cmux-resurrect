> **Save, restore, and template your terminal workspaces — for [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).**

Inspired by [tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect), **crex** was born to do for [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) what tmux-resurrect does for tmux — and then went further. With an **interactive shell**, a **template gallery**, **Blueprints**, and a **watch daemon**, crex saves your entire layout and brings it back: all your tabs, pane arrangements, working directories, pinned state, and startup commands. Named after the corncrake (*Crex crex*), a bird that returns to the same ground year after year — your terminal's own phoenix.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install with Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew install drolosoft/tap/crex            # preferred
brew install drolosoft/tap/cmux-resurrect  # legacy alias — same formula
```

Both `crex` and `cmux-resurrect` commands are ready to use (`cmux-resurrect` is the legacy name), with shell completions installed automatically. No Go toolchain required. macOS only (both cmux and Ghostty's AppleScript API are macOS-native).

### Install with `go install`

```sh
go install github.com/drolosoft/cmux-resurrect/cmd/crex@latest
```

> For building from source, see [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

### Install this fork / development branch

The Homebrew formula above installs the upstream release. To use unreleased cmux SSH workspace and Codex session restore support from this fork, build the active branch directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/imsj114/cmux-resurrect.git
cd cmux-resurrect
git checkout plan/cmux-ssh-restore
make build
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
install -m 0755 bin/crex ~/.local/bin/crex
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is before any Homebrew `crex` in your shell path:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
which crex
crex version
```

For another Mac, push this branch first, then run the same clone/build/install commands there. Saved layouts live in `~/.config/crex/layouts/`; copy or sync that directory if you want the same saved layouts on another machine.

### Enable Shell Completion

Homebrew users get completions automatically. For manual installs, add one line to your shell config:

```sh
eval "$(crex completion zsh)"    # zsh — add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(crex completion bash)"   # bash — add to ~/.bashrc
crex completion fish | source    # fish — run once
```

Now `crex <TAB>` shows all commands, `crex restore <TAB>` completes your saved layout names, and flags like `--mode` complete their values. See [docs/shell-completion.md](docs/shell-completion.md) for the full guide.

### Try it

```sh
crex setup                                # guided first-run configuration
crex save my-day                          # snapshot your current layout
crex save my-day -d "Friday deep work"    # with a description
crex tui                                  # interactive shell
```

<p align="center"><img src="assets/quickstart.gif" alt="crex quick start" width="800"></p>

---

## 💾 Save & Restore

```sh
crex save my-day                          # snapshot your layout
crex save my-day -d "Friday deep work"    # add a description (preserved across re-saves)
crex save home-shared --remote-only        # save only cmux SSH remote workspaces
crex restore my-day                       # bring it all back
```

Every tab, pane arrangement, CWD, pinned state, and startup command — captured and restored. Layouts are saved to `~/.config/crex/layouts/`.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/save-my-day.png" alt="crex save my-day" width="700"></p>

### cmux SSH workspaces and Codex sessions

For cmux, crex can restore workspaces created with `cmux ssh <destination>`. It recreates the remote workspace, pane structure, terminal/browser surfaces, and per-pane working directories.

If a terminal surface is running Codex, crex records the active Codex session ID and restores it with `codex resume <session-id>` after returning to the captured working directory. crex first reads cmux Codex hook state when available, and also falls back to inspecting the active remote Codex process so sessions can be captured even when hook state has not been installed.

Remote SSH replay is exact when cmux exposes all connection fields. If cmux reports hidden SSH options or identity files, crex saves a warning and preserves any manually added `identity_file` / `ssh_option` fields in the layout TOML.

### Sharing layouts with Syncthing

To share layouts across Macs without a Git workflow, sync only the layout directory with [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). Keep `config.toml` machine-local unless every machine should use the exact same crex settings.

Recommended topology with an always-on home server:

```text
Mac A        ~/.config/crex/layouts/
  <---->     home server ~/sync/crex-layouts/
  <---->     Mac B ~/.config/crex/layouts/
```

Install and start Syncthing:

```sh
# macOS
brew install syncthing
brew services start syncthing

# Ubuntu home server
sudo apt-get install syncthing
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user enable --now syncthing.service
```

Then open Syncthing's UI and connect the devices:

```sh
# local Mac UI
open http://127.0.0.1:8384

# home server UI through SSH
ssh -L 8385:127.0.0.1:8384 home
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8385
```

Create one folder on each device with the same folder ID:

| Device | Folder ID | Path |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Mac | `crex-layouts` | `~/.config/crex/layouts` |
| home server | `crex-layouts` | `~/sync/crex-layouts` |
| another Mac | `crex-layouts` | `~/.config/crex/layouts` |

Use folder type `Send & Receive` on trusted personal devices. After pairing, `crex save test` on one Mac updates `test.toml` and Syncthing propagates it to the others.

If the layout is meant to work on multiple Macs, save the shared copy with `--remote-only`:

```sh
crex save home-shared --remote-only
```

This stores only workspaces created through `cmux ssh ...`. Local Mac-only workspaces, local paths, and local terminal surfaces are skipped, while remote pane structure, remote working directories, browser surfaces, and resumable Codex session IDs are still captured.

Layout TOML can contain local paths, remote host names, SSH replay hints, URLs, and Codex session IDs. Sync this folder only between trusted private devices; do not put it in a public shared folder.

## 🧙 Setup Wizard

First time? `crex setup` walks you through everything:

```sh
crex setup              # interactive guided configuration
crex setup --defaults   # accept all defaults (CI/scripting)
```

The wizard auto-detects your terminal backend (cmux or Ghostty), creates a default `config.toml` if missing, and sets up the layouts directory. One command and you're ready to go.

## 🖥️ Interactive Shell

Run `crex tui` — or just `crex` when config exists — to drop into the interactive shell. A `crex❯` prompt gives you full access to all commands without leaving your terminal.

```
crex❯ ls                     list saved layouts
crex❯ restore 2              restore by number
crex❯ now                    show live terminal state
crex❯ templates              browse the gallery
crex❯ use claude             create workspace from template
crex❯ bp list                list Blueprint entries
crex❯ help                   show all commands
```

Listings show numbered items — use the number in any follow-up command. Arrow keys browse listings inline. The shell adapts to your terminal's dark or light theme automatically.

## 📥 Blueprints

Define your terminal layout in Obsidian-compatible Markdown. Import creates only what's missing — it's idempotent.

```markdown
## Projects
**Icon | Name | Template | Pin | Path**

- [x] | 🌐 | webapp    | dev     | yes | ~/projects/webapp
- [x] | ⚙️ | api       | dev     | yes | ~/projects/api-server
- [x] | 🧪 | tests     | go      | yes | ~/projects/testing

## Templates

### dev
- [x] main terminal (focused)
- [x] split right: `npm run dev`
- [x] split right: `lazygit`
```

```sh
crex import-from-md           # create tabs/workspaces from Blueprint
crex export-to-md             # capture live state to Blueprint
```

<p align="center"><img src="assets/import-success.png" alt="crex import-from-md in action" width="800"></p>

> For the full Blueprint format and CLI management (`bp add`, `bp list`, `bp toggle`), see [docs/blueprint.md](docs/blueprint.md).

## Supported Backends

| Backend | Status | Platform | Tested versions | Detection |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) | Full support (original backend) | macOS | 0.62.1, 0.63.2 | Auto-detected via `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` |
| [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) | Full support (AppleScript API) | macOS | 1.3 | Auto-detected when Ghostty is running |

> **macOS only.** Both backends rely on macOS-native APIs (cmux is a macOS terminal multiplexer; the Ghostty backend uses AppleScript). Linux support will follow once Ghostty ships a cross-platform scripting API ([ghostty-org/ghostty#2353](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/2353)).

crex auto-detects your terminal backend — no flags needed. Just run your commands and crex figures out the rest:

```sh
crex save my-day        # works in cmux or Ghostty
crex restore my-day     # recreates layout in whichever backend you're in
crex template use dev   # same templates, any backend
```

All features — save, restore, import, export, templates, Blueprints — work identically across backends. The template gallery is 100% backend-agnostic.

**Adaptive Themes** — crex auto-detects your terminal's dark/light background and adjusts banner colors. Three styles available: `flame` (gradient, default), `classic` (solid green), `plain` (gray). Set `banner_style` in `config.toml` or use `CREX_BANNER`; override detection with `CREX_THEME=dark|light`. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## ✨ Why crex?

[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) proved that session persistence is essential for any serious terminal multiplexer workflow. Every multiplexer eventually gets one — crex started as that tool for cmux, and now brings the same power to Ghostty.

| | tmux-resurrect | crex |
|:---:|---|---|
| 🖥️ | CLI commands only | **Interactive shell** — `crex❯` REPL with browse mode, number refs, history |
| 📝 | Plugin configuration | **Blueprints** — Markdown files, Obsidian-compatible |
| 🧩 | Manual pane recreation | **16 built-in templates** + custom Blueprints |
| 📥 | One-way restore | **Bidirectional** — import from and export to Markdown |
| 👁️ | Execute immediately | **Dry-run mode** — preview every command first |
| ⏱️ | Manual saves | **Watch daemon** — background auto-save, deduped, shell hooks, zero-maintenance |
| 📋 | Edit config files | **CLI blueprint management** — `add`, `remove`, `toggle` from terminal |
| 🔤 | Basic tab completion | **Dynamic completions** — layout names, blueprint names, flag values (bash/zsh/fish) |
